# GapMap
We created a shiny app called GapMap where we can explore the relationship between the severity (number of confirmed cases and deaths) of COVID-19 and health insurance coverage in the US at a county level. The user can look into a direct correlation graph or look at a spatial map/representation of the correlation. The user can also access the code used to make the app by clicking at the source code tab. The sources used for the app are cited and included in a seperate file called Citation.
